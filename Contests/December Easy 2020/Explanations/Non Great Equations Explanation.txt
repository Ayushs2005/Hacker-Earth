Let us rearrange the equation to take advantage of the symmetry.

a^2 + b^3 = c^2 

b^3 = c^2 - a^2 = (c + a)(c - a)

Suppose, we have two factors of b^3 = pq, 

Then, c + a = p, c - a = q 

But b^3 is too big to fit into 64 bits or be factorised. 

But, b and b^2 are both divisors of b^3 ! 

c + a = b^2 
c - a = b 

c = (b^2 + b)/2, a = (b^2 - b)/2

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	long long a, b, c;
	cin >> b;

	c = (b*b + b)/2;
	a = (b*b - b)/2;

	cout << a << " " << c << "\n";
	return 0;
}
